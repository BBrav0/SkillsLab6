# Project Description:
Our project is a simple calculator created in python and hosted in Jupyter! It essentially asks for the user to enter their name, two numbers, and an operation to 
perform. The python program will then do the mathematical calculations and output the result as a String that reads "Hello name, welcome to the calculator" and then gives the output of the user specified operation. 
 
 # Getting Started
 To run our program, first do the following steps:
 
 1.) Log into Jupyter using your crudentials 
 2.) Navigate files to make sure Untitled.ipynb is in your directory
 3.) Run the program!

# How to Use Program:
    1.) First enter your name. You will see a prompt like ```What's your name?```
    2.) Next, enter number 1 of 2
    3.) Enter number 2 of 2
    4.) Lastly, select a mathematical operation to be performed
    5.) Done! You should now see the output!
